# Clicky-Game-React-App

Memory game build using React.Js. 
How it works...

This app presents different images, and each "reacts" to click events... here's how.

The user earns a point when they click on each image, and the images shuffle upon each click... however, their score resets to 0 if the same image is clicked more than once, and which resets the game.
